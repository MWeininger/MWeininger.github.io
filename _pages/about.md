I am a researcher interested in the formal verification of safety-critical systems.

I did my PhD at [Technical University of Munich](https://www.cit.tum.de/cit/startseite/) under the supervision of [Jan Kretinsky](https://www7.in.tum.de/~kretinsk/).
Then, I was a Marie Sklodowska-Curie fellow ([IST-BRIDGE](https://ist.ac.at/en/education/postdocs/ist-bridge/)) at the [Institute of Science and Technology Austria](https://ist.ac.at/en/education/postdocs/ist-bridge/), working with [Krishnendu Chatterjee](https://ist.ac.at/en/education/postdocs/ist-bridge/).
Currently, I am a PostDoc in [the AI-FM group](https://informatik.rub.de/en/research/chairs/aifm/) lead by [Nils Jansen](https://nilsjansen.org/) at the [Ruhr-University Bochum](https://informatik.rub.de/en/).
